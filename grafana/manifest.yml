  plugins for many different way to visualize metrics and logs.


  * Dynamic Dashboards: Create dynamic & reusable dashboards with template variables
  that appear as dropdowns at the top of the dashboard.


  * Explore Metrics: Explore your data through ad-hoc queries and dynamic drilldown.
  Split view and compare different time ranges, queries and data sources side by side.


  * Explore Logs: Experience the magic of switching from metrics to logs with preserved
